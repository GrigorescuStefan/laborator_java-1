Trying to lean bits and pieces of how Java works as well as Git, uploaded using GitKraken.

This is an application that has a few files about students, professors as well as courses. It has a log in function and different options depending on who created the
account, a student or a professor. It is used by students to view their courses, the professors for each course and their grades, as well as professors to view the courses
they have, the students, and the option to grade each student directly from the GUI.
